<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
<p>Time complexity is the measure of how long an algorithm takes to execute. It is typically expressed in terms of the size of the input data. For example, an algorithm with a time complexity of O(n) takes time proportional to the size of the input data. An efficient algorithm has a low time complexity, meaning that it takes a short amount of time to execute.</p>
<p>Space complexity is the measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses. It is also typically expressed in terms of the size of the input data. For example, an algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) uses memory proportional to the size of the input data. An efficient algorithm has a low space complexity, meaning that it uses a small amount of memory.</p>
<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is the amount of memory used by an algorithm to execute. It is important to consider both time complexity and space complexity when designing algorithms, as both can have a significant impact on the performance of the algorithm.</p>

 <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
 <p>Time complexity is a measure of how long an algorithm takes to run, in terms of the number of operations it performs. It is typically expressed as a function of the input size. An efficient algorithm has a low time complexity, meaning that it can solve problems quickly even for large input sizes.</p>
 <p> Space complexity is a measure of how much memory an algorithm uses, in terms of the number of memory cells it needs to store data. It is also typically expressed as a function of the input size. An algorithm with a low space complexity is said to be memory efficient.</p>
 <p>In many cases, there is a tradeoff between time complexity and space complexity. An algorithm may be faster if it uses more memory, or it may be more memory-efficient if it takes longer to run. When choosing an algorithm, it is important to consider both the time and space complexity to ensure that it will be efficient for the problem at hand.</p>
